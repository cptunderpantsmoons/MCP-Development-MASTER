# Security Guidelines for Cybersecurity MCP Server

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices and guidelines for deploying and using the Cybersecurity Tools MCP Server.

## Security Architecture

### Container Isolation
- Each tool execution runs in an isolated Docker container
- Containers are automatically removed after execution
- Resource limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Network isolation restricts container communication

### Access Control
- Token-based authentication for sensitive tools
- Role-based access control (RBAC) support
- IP address whitelisting capabilities
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete execution logging
- Immutable audit trails
- Retention policies for log management
- Compliance with security frameworks

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Change default authentication tokens
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Set resource limits
- [ ] Configure backup procedures
- [ ] Implement monitoring
- [ ] Review access controls
- [ ] Update security patches

### Network Security

```yaml
# Secure network configuration
security:
  allowed_targets:
    - "10.0.0.0/8"           # Internal networks only
    - "*.testdomain.com"     # Authorized test domains
  blocked_targets:
    - "localhost"
    - "127.0.0.1"
    - "169.254.0.0/16"       # Link-local addresses
```

### Container Security

```yaml
# Secure container configuration
docker:
  security_opt:
    - "no-new-privileges:true"
  cap_drop:
    - "ALL"
  cap_add:
    - "NET_RAW"              # Only for network tools
  read_only: true
  tmpfs:
    - "/tmp:noexec,nosuid"
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Authorized Use Only
- Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Obtain written authorization before testing third-party systems
- Comply with local laws and regulations
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Tool-Specific Security

#### SQLMap
- Requires explicit authorization token
- All database interactions are logged
- Automatic detection of sensitive data exposure
- Rate limiting to prevent service disruption

#### Metasploit
- Disabled by default in production
- Requires special authorization
- All exploitation attempts logged
- Payload generation restricted

#### Network Scanners
- Rate limiting prevents network flooding
- Target validation prevents scanning prohibited networks
- Stealth mode available for authorized testing

## Incident Response

### Security Event Types
1. Unauthorized access attempts
2. Resource limit violations
3. Prohibited target scanning
4. Tool misuse or abuse

### Response Procedures
1. Immediate containment
2. Evidence preservation
3. Impact assessment
4. Remediation actions
5. Lessons learned

### Logging and Monitoring

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-06-09T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "unauthorized_access",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "target": "prohibited-domain.com",
  "action_taken": "request_blocked",
  "severity": "high"
}
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data stored permanently
- Automatic log rotation and deletion
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access logging and monitoring

### Regulatory Compliance
- SOC 2 Type II controls
- ISO 27001 alignment
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Industry-specific requirements

## Security Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- Monthly security patch updates
- Quarterly tool updates
- Annual security assessment
- Continuous vulnerability monitoring

### Update Procedures
1. Test updates in staging environment
2. Schedule maintenance windows
3. Backup configuration and logs
4. Apply updates with rollback plan
5. Verify functionality post-update
