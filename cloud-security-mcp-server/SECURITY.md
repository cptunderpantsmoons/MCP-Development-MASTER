# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Cloud Security MCP Server team and community take security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

üìß **security@example.com**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-factor authentication** support for cloud provider access
- **Role-based access control** for different user types
- **API key rotation** capabilities
- **Least privilege** access principles

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at rest** for scan results and configuration
- **Encryption in transit** for all API communications
- **Secure credential storage** using industry standards
- **Data retention policies** for scan artifacts

### Network Security

- **TLS 1.3** for all network communications
- **Certificate pinning** for critical endpoints
- **Network segmentation** recommendations
- **VPC/Private network** deployment options

### Container Security

- **Minimal base images** with security updates
- **Non-root user execution** in containers
- **Read-only file systems** where possible
- **Security scanning** of container images

## üîç Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå |

## üö® Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep software updated** to the latest version
2. **Use strong credentials** for cloud provider access
3. **Enable MFA** wherever possible
4. **Monitor access logs** regularly
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**
6. **Regularly rotate credentials**
7. **Use secure networks** for deployment
8. **Review scan results** for sensitive data before sharing

### For Developers

1. **Follow secure coding practices**
2. **Validate all inputs** from external sources
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database access
4. **Implement proper error handling** without information leakage
5. **Log security events** appropriately
6. **Use static analysis tools** during development
7. **Conduct security reviews** for all code changes

### For Deployment

1. **Use encrypted storage** for configuration and results
2. **Deploy in private networks** when possible
3. **Monitor system resources** and access patterns
4. **Implement backup and recovery** procedures
5. **Use container security scanning**
6. **Keep base systems updated**
7. **Configure firewalls** appropriately

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools Integration

### Vulnerability Scanning

The project includes integration with:

- **Trivy** for container vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit** for Python security analysis
- **Safety** for dependency vulnerability checking
- **SAST** tools in CI/CD pipeline

### Security Monitoring

- **Log aggregation** for security events
- **Metrics collection** for anomaly detection
- **Alert thresholds** for suspicious activities
- **Audit trails** for all security-relevant actions

## üìã Security Compliance

### Standards Adherence

- **OWASP Top 10** security risks mitigation
- **CIS Controls** implementation guidance
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** alignment
- **SOC 2** compliance considerations

### Regular Security Activities

- **Quarterly security reviews** of codebase
- **Annual penetration testing** by third parties
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** in CI/CD
- **Security training** for all contributors

## üöÄ Incident Response

### Response Process

1. **Initial Assessment** (within 2 hours)
   - Severity classification
   - Impact assessment
   - Stakeholder notification

2. **Investigation** (within 24 hours)
   - Root cause analysis
   - Affected systems identification
   - Evidence collection

3. **Containment** (immediate for critical issues)
   - System isolation if needed
   - Access revocation
   - Temporary mitigations

4. **Resolution** (timeline varies by severity)
   - Patch development
   - Testing and validation
   - Deployment coordination

5. **Post-Incident** (within 1 week)
   - Lessons learned documentation
   - Process improvements
   - User communication

### Severity Classifications

- **Critical**: Remote code execution, data breach, complete system compromise
- **High**: Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure, denial of service
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, weak authentication, configuration issues
- **Low**: Minor information leakage, low-impact vulnerabilities

## üìû Emergency Contacts

For critical security incidents requiring immediate attention:

- **Primary**: security@example.com
- **Backup**: security-urgent@example.com
- **Phone**: +1-555-SECURITY (for critical issues only)

## üîÑ Updates to This Policy

This security policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by:

- Posting updates to this document
- Sending notifications to registered users
- Announcing changes in release notes

## üìú Legal

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and do not access unnecessary data
- Do not perform testing on production systems without permission
- Provide reasonable time for vulnerability remediation

### Responsible Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Initial response and triage
- **Day 3-7**: Investigation and impact assessment
- **Day 8-30**: Patch development and testing
- **Day 31-90**: Coordinated disclosure (timeline varies by severity)

## üèÜ Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities may be recognized in:

- **Security acknowledgments** in release notes
- **Hall of Fame** on project website
- **Researcher credits** in vulnerability advisories
